# README

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `main.ipynb`. The project focuses on predicting house prices using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## File Description
- **`main.ipynb`**: This notebook contains the entire workflow for predicting house prices, including loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training an XGBoost model, and evaluating its performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  *(If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, install these key libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost)*

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install the required libraries as mentioned above.

### Running the Notebook
To run the notebook, execute the following:
```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: Contains the entire machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, training the XGBoost model, and making predictions on house prices.
- [Add other files or folders if present, e.g., datasets, scripts, or config files.]

## Usage
1. Open the notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess the data and train the model.
2. Modify hyperparameters or features as needed to customize the model for your dataset.
3. Run the final cells to generate predictions for the test data.

## Contributing
